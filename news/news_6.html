        <p>
            sooo i am a little late on this but Valve just announced new Hardware!!!
            <br>
            <br>
            I am so fucking hyped, not just because its new hardware but because i hope this is a Sign for Half Life X.
            Valve just thought:"if everything can be an X-Box then why don't we do it better?"
            And they saw the meta quest and said:"Man we can do that better." and did that.
            But what i think is that for every hardware release they made either a Portal or Half life game specifically for it.
            So i wonder if they do that again.
