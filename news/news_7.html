        <p>
            Not so daily news here with todays topic: Horror!
            <br><br>
            So horror is an interesting genre. There are so many different types of horror games.
            My favourite is probably existential horror.
            So something like its all not real and shit.
            I like small indie horror games the most probably.
            <br><br>
            I played <span style="text-shadow: 3px 3px 3px;" title="phasmophobia">phasmo</span> with a few friends a bit ago.
            That was fun. 
            I also really like minecraft ARG's or mc horror mods.
