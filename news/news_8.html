        <p>
            So a few days ago a few people were going trough a Forest.
            And they just randomly found the filming of the Zelda movie.
            What are the odds of that? 
            <br><br>
            I did'nt watch it fully just a few seconds and im not gonna link it here,
            but i think it was just a few horses and the actors.
            But like how does that even happen?
            And Nintendo even confirmed they were starting filming shortly after that.
            <br><br>
            I am really hyped about the Movie and i hope it will be great!
