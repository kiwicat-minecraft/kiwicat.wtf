        <p>
            So its been a Month now huh?
            But i am back!
            With new reviews like <a target="_parent" href="/reviews/Pokemon_lets_go.html">Pokemon lets go</a>
            and more!
            I also wanted to say merry Christmas to those who do it! :3
            <br>
            I also bought Clone Drone in the Danger Zone today so maybe there will be a Review on that someday.
