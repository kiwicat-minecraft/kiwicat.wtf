        <p>
            Oh it seems you got send here by accident!
            Well now you are stuck here with me i guess.
            So how do you escape this hell?
            The buttons don't work anymore and pressing main would take so long.
            <br><br>
            Just press <a target="_parent" href="/news/">this</a> to get back or stay here.

            <br><br><br>
            For those wondering why this has happend its because my code wanted to turn a string into a number.
            But Thats Not a Number so NaN.
            And because of how my code works i can just write a news articel for NaN.
