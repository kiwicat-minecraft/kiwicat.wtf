        <h2>Donkey Kong Bananza</h2>

        <p>
            The really nailed it again. The odyssey makers just can't not deliver.
            The game is in many ways like odyssey from the stuff like mouvement and 
            to the way they handle the dialoge system. Mario Odyssey was my first own Game so it holds a special place in my Heart.
            I played it so often and even started mod... 
            <br>

            So hey because of my Lawyers i will now really talk about Bananza.
            I only played trough one Game more quickly and that is Mario Wonder (maybe i will review it sometime).
            <br>
            <br>
            The mechanics are great and the Gameplay is even better.
            The new capabilities of the Switch 2 really let it shine.
            ENDGAME SPOILERS: <span class="spoiler">[The ending was such a wild ride from the fake credits to the end fight it was just PEAK]</span>
            The Game is so rewarding with the Gold and has so many Great Twists.
            I truly hope the modd...

            <br>
            <br>
            Anyways Have Fun!!!
