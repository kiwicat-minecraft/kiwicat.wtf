            I Love the devs and they keep updating the game with new features and bugfixes. The achievements are integrated really well and the gameplay is just fantastic. I love seeing my friends brutally fall of a hang because i couldn’t hold them! The skill ceiling is really high. A friend got alone to the peak after all three of us died.

            I got the game gifted from a friend so my thanks goes out to her and the devs.
