        <p>
            So i have this little Quest of playing and reviewing all newer Pokemon Games.
            I played the Eevee version but it does'nt matter for this review.
            <br>
            <br>
            So whats the thing that defines Pokemon?
            Its fighting.
            So why the Fuck did they think removing fighting for catching was a good idea?
            <br>
            The Game looks good but i can't deal with Pokemon without Pokemon.
            <br>
            <br>
            This Game gets a score of: <span class="score" id="score_5">5/10</span>
            <br>
            I can see People enjoing it.
